# CineScope_CS661

CS661 Project : Cinescope : Global Movie Trend Analysis via TMDB
This project revolves around an interactive visual analytics dashboard built using Python - Plotly & Dash  to explore global movie trends from the TMDB dataset.

Dataset Description :
The project uses TMDB dataset from Kaggle (~930k entries), containing rich metadata like genres, revenue, runtime, languages, and production info. A master CSV file (TMDB_movie_dataset_v11.csv) serves as the core for all visualizations and computations. Extensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and standardization steps were applied to ensure consistency and enable meaningful visual analytics.
